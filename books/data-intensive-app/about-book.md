#Overview
In the last decade there are a lot of changes in DB, distributed system and in the ways we build apps on top of them.

1. Big companies handle huge data with big scale.
2. Be agile - test hypotheses cheaply, respond to marketing quickly, short development cycle
3. Open source is very successful
4. Parallelism is ready - CPU clock is barely increasing but comes with more cores
5. Cloud infrastructure - a small team can build distributed system
6. Highly available services

The book is to help navigate the diverse and fast-changing landscape of technologies for processing and storing data.
